# Stable API Versions

This directory contains documentation for older, stable versions of our API.

## Overview

While we continually work to improve and expand our API offerings, we understand that many developers rely on consistent, well-established endpoints for their applications. This section houses the documentation for our previous stable API versions.

## Version Support

We maintain support for older API versions for a specified period to ensure a smooth transition for our developers. Please refer to our API lifecycle policy for details on how long each version will be supported.

## Deprecation Notices

Any deprecation notices for features or endpoints within these stable versions will be clearly marked in the relevant documentation.

## Feedback

While these API versions are considered stable, we always appreciate feedback. If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvement, please don't hesitate to contact our developer support team.

## Moving to Newer Versions

We encourage developers to stay up-to-date with our latest API versions when possible. Check our main API documentation for information on the most current release and its new features.

Thank you for your continued use of our API. We're committed to providing a stable and reliable development experience across all supported versions.
